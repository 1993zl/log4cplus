log4cplus 2.0-RC1

**IMPORTANT**: Implementation language is now C++11. OS specific
implementations have been replaced by C++11 facilities wherever
possible. This lowers complexity of the library and improves maintainability
but it also brings limitations to when the library can be used. Specifically,
the library should not be used before `main()` is entered and after `main()`
is left. Even more specifically, the library should not be used during global
objects construction and destruction.
